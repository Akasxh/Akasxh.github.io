      <h2>About this blog</h2>
      <p>This personal blog is where I write about a variety of topics. I previously wrote on another platform but moved here to create a more casual space for my thoughts.</p>
      <p>The content can range from technical notes and essays to poetry or just random ideas. I aim to write succinct and approachable pieces that reflect my interests and experiences.</p>
      <p>If you want to know more about me or get in touch, feel free to visit my main website.</p>
