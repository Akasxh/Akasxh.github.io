      <p>For my senior project I collaborated on a tool for testing translations between programming languages. The idea was to check whether a program rewritten in a different language behaved the same as the original.</p>
      <p>Along the way we had to design effective test suites, handle subtle semantic differences and automate the process as much as possible. Building such a framework taught me a lot about software quality.</p>
      <p>This post summarises the challenges we encountered and the insights gained during the development of our testing framework.</p>
